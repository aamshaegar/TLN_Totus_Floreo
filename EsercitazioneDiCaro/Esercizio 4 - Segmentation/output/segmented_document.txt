The Northern Lights are the visible result of solar particles entering the earth's magnetic field and ionizing high in the atmosphere.
Their intensity depends on the activity of the sun and the acceleration speed of these particles.
They appear as dancing lights high in the sky and vary in color.
The lights usually appear green, but occasionally also purple, red, pink, orange, and blue.
Their colors depend on the elements being ionized.
Solar activity is not regular, however.
Even if it is a dark, clear night, there could still be absolutely no chance of seeing the auroras due to a lack of solar activity.
It also means that the sky could be alive with Northern Lights on a midsummer day, but the sun's brightness obscures them.



Due to the nature of the earth's magnetic field, the auroras only appear at the poles.
I love to pet my cat while reading fantasy books.
The fur of my cat is so fluffy that chills me.
It entertain me, its tail sometimes goes over my pages and meows, also showing me the weird pattern in its chest's fur.
Sometimes, it plays with me but hurts me with its claws and once it scratched me so bad the one drop of blood felt over my favourite book's pages.
Even so, its agile and soft body at least warms me and appease me with its cute fur, meow and purr, so I alwayse forgive it and those little drops of damage.



Every time a cat is put aside of a character, i cannot prevent remembering when I found it malnourished and lacking in fur.
The end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December is looming, and with it some major changes for anyone going from the UK to continental Europe â€“ either to holiday, work or live.
Some have been confirmed but others are dependent on continuing negotiations over a deal.
